## Example 1: Accessibility and Visual Impairment

```
Title: Web Accessibility Challenges for Visually Impaired Users in E-Commerce

This study examines accessibility barriers faced by visually impaired users when navigating 
e-commerce websites. Through interviews with 50 participants and usability testing on 25 
popular shopping platforms, our findings reveal significant challenges including inadequate 
screen reader support, missing alternative text for product images, and complex navigation 
structures that are difficult to parse with assistive technology. Participants reported 
difficulty completing purchases independently, with 85% requiring assistance from sighted 
users at some point during the checkout process. The research highlights the urgent need 
for WCAG 2.1 compliance and user testing with people with disabilities during website 
development. Recommendations include implementing proper ARIA labels, ensuring keyboard 
navigation for all functions, and providing text alternatives for all visual content. 
When these guidelines are followed, success rates for independent shopping increased by 
67%, demonstrating the practical impact of accessible design on user autonomy and 
participation in digital commerce.

## Example 2: Elderly and Technology

```
Title: Digital Divide: Technology Access and Literacy Barriers for Older Adults

This longitudinal study tracked 200 adults aged 65+ over 18 months to understand barriers 
to technology adoption and digital literacy. Key findings indicate that older adults face 
multiple interconnected challenges including limited prior exposure to digital devices, 
small text and touch targets that are difficult to see and manipulate with age-related 
vision and dexterity changes, and insufficient training resources designed for their learning 
pace. Many participants expressed feelings of anxiety and frustration when attempting to 
use smartphones or computers, with 72% reporting they had given up trying to learn certain 
applications. The research also identified social isolation as both a cause and consequence 
of digital exclusion, as video calling and social media become primary communication methods. 
Economic barriers were significant, with 40% of participants unable to afford devices or 
internet service. The study recommends age-friendly interface design with larger fonts and 
simplified navigation, community-based training programs with patient instructors, and 
subsidized internet and device access programs for low-income seniors.

## Example 3: Students with Learning Disabilities

```
Title: Educational Barriers for Students with Dyslexia in Online Learning Environments

This study explores the challenges faced by students with dyslexia and other learning 
disabilities in online educational platforms, particularly during remote learning. Through 
surveys of 300 students and interviews with 45 educators, we identified critical accessibility 
gaps that impede learning outcomes. Major challenges include poor font choices that make 
reading difficult (such as serif fonts and insufficient spacing), timed assessments that 
disadvantage students who process text more slowly, lack of text-to-speech integration, 
and video content without adequate captions or transcripts. Students reported spending 
2-3 times longer than peers to complete reading assignments, leading to increased stress 
and reduced comprehension. The absence of dyslexia-friendly features like customizable 
text colors, line spacing adjustments, and screen reader compatibility created significant 
barriers to equal participation. The research recommends that educational platforms implement 
OpenDyslexic or similar fonts, provide untimed or flexible-time assessments, integrate 
text-to-speech functionality, and offer multimodal content delivery (text, audio, video) 
to support diverse learning needs. When these accommodations were implemented in pilot 
programs, student engagement increased by 54% and completion rates improved by 38%.
```

**Suggested Filters:**
- User Group: Students
- Category: Education

**Expected Challenges:**
- Poor font choices for dyslexia
- Timed assessments
- Lack of text-to-speech
- Missing captions and transcripts
- Insufficient customization options
- Extended time requirements
- Increased stress and reduced comprehension

## Example 4: Low-Income Communities and Healthcare

```
Title: Healthcare Access Barriers in Low-Income Urban Communities

This community-based participatory research project examined healthcare accessibility 
challenges in low-income urban neighborhoods over a 2-year period. Working with 500 
residents and 30 community health workers, the study documented systemic barriers including 
unreliable public transportation limiting access to medical appointments, inability to take 
time off work for healthcare visits due to lack of paid sick leave, high costs of care 
even with insurance due to copays and deductibles, language barriers with English-only 
healthcare providers, and distrust of medical institutions stemming from historical 
discrimination. The research found that 62% of participants delayed or skipped necessary 
care due to these barriers, leading to preventable health complications. Mental health 
services were particularly inaccessible, with wait times exceeding 6 months. Children in 
these communities had vaccination rates 30% below the national average. The study recommends 
establishing community health centers with extended evening and weekend hours, providing 
multilingual services, implementing sliding-scale payment systems, offering telehealth 
options to reduce transportation barriers, and conducting culturally sensitive outreach 
to build trust with historically marginalized populations.

## Example 5: Cognitive Disabilities and Navigation

```
Title: Environmental Navigation Challenges for Adults with Cognitive Disabilities

This qualitative study investigated how adults with cognitive disabilities (including 
intellectual disabilities, traumatic brain injury, and dementia) navigate public spaces 
and transportation systems. Through observation studies with 75 participants and interviews 
with caregivers, the research identified key barriers to independent mobility. Participants 
struggled with complex signage that used abstract symbols or technical language, confusing 
multi-step directions, overwhelming sensory environments with loud noises and crowds, and 
lack of clear wayfinding cues. Many reported feeling anxious about getting lost and relied 
heavily on familiar routes, limiting their independence and community participation. Public 
transportation was particularly challenging, with 80% requiring assistance to navigate bus 
or train systems. Digital navigation apps were often too complex, requiring multiple steps 
and presenting information in inaccessible formats. The study recommends implementing 
universal design principles in public spaces, including clear, simple signage with both 
text and pictograms, step-by-step wayfinding with landmarks, quieter waiting areas, and 
accessible navigation apps with simplified interfaces and voice guidance. Pilot programs 
using these approaches increased independent navigation by 45%.
